I missed adding some info here. In the top box where is has "Google CA" it should be "Google ICA". GeoTrust is the root CA. Google ICA is an intermediate CA that issues SSL on behalf of GeoTrust. NSCC does not go to GeoTrust to get an SSL cert, it only needs to go to Google ICA. Google ICA issues the SSL Cert. Since Google ICA is not a root CA, no one has the Google ICA certificate stored in their browsers or Operating System. Therefore Google ICA needs to send its public certificate along with the SSL certificate and both certs are installed in the NSCC web server. When a client connects to NSCC, both the Google ICA and the SSL cert are sent to the client. The client first validates the Google ICA cert because this cert is signed by GeoTrust and all clients have the GeoTrust CA public cert in their OS or browser. Now the ICA is validated, the client uses the public key in the ICA cert to validate the SSL certificate, verifying it comes from NSCC. The client now trusts NSCC public key contained in its SSL cert. So there is one Root CA (GeoTrust) one ICA (Google) and then an SSL Cert for NSCC (this is not consided an intermediate cert.)﻿
